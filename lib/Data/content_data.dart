          'In 1880, the Taiping Hospital (previously known as Hospital Yeng Wah) was established as Perak\'s first medical institution. Prior to World War II, it served as a principal state hospital. It is currently the second largest hospital in Perak and serves as a referral centre for many hospitals and clinics in the surrounding region and district. They aim to provide the best care possible, especially to the population in this district, and to ensure that the community\'s health status can be enhanced and fulfilled with the services provided.',
